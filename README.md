Configs for **Sweep36** or **Swweeep**, a 36-keys split keyboard.

**Caution**: syntax errors, e.g.: using non-existent fields, might result in unexpected behavior such
as halves not connecting to each other.

## TODOs

- [ ] Easier access for Symbols layer
- [ ] Safer access to sys keys: with a combo that activates a layer for a period of time
- [ ] fix bluetooth random disconnect after some time
- [ ] pinkies are kinda hard of triggering the key press (is this because
      of strenght or my keyboard?)
